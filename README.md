DataWash Pro Max - Premium CSV Cleaning Service

Brief Description

DataWash Pro Max is an automated, high-speed CSV file cleaning service. It helps users by:

Cleaning: Removing duplicate rows (deduplication).

Validation: Removing incomplete rows (handling missing or incomplete data).

Export: Returning a cleaned CSV file and a secure download URL.

This project is structured into two main parts:

Backend (Node.js/Express): Handles all the data cleaning logic and API serving.

Frontend (React/Tailwind UI): The Premium Dashboard UI that consumes the API.

Setup and Installation

A. Backend (Node.js/Express)

Clone the Repository:

git clone [Your Repository URL]
cd DataWash-CSV


Install Dependencies:

npm install


Run the Server (Local Testing):

npm start
# The server will be listening on http://localhost:3000 (or your configured port)


B. Frontend (React Dashboard)

The Dashboard (DataWash.jsx) communicates with the Backend API for the cleaning process.

Crucial Steps for Deployment:

Deploy the Backend: Use a service like Render or Vercel to host and run your index.js and package.json files online.

Update the API URL: Replace the API_URL variable inside the DataWash.jsx file with the live URL provided by your deployment service (e.g., https://my-datawash-server.onrender.com/upload).

Deploy the Frontend: Deploy your React application (the Dashboard).

Technologies Used
